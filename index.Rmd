### Bio 

I am a social worker and currently a PhD candidate in social welfare at the Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. 

My research is broadly in the area of nonprofit studies. Currently, I'm focused on community organization dynamics, including the distribution of organizations and the benefits they bring to their regions. I also maintain an interest in program evaluation and applied statistics (particularly hierarchical models and rich parameterizations).
