### Biography 

Trained as a social worker, I became broadly curious about social science and the role of organizations in society.  I am currently a PhD candidate in social welfare at the Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. 

As a researcher I am broadly curious about quantitative methodology in the social sciences and the role of organizations in society. My research has covered a range of topics in organizational studies, including finance and data use. Currently, I am most interested in community-organizations dynamics and organizational demography; the distribution of organizations and the benefits they bring to their regions. 

I also maintain an interest in program evaluation and applied statistics, particularly hierarchical models and spatial statistics.
