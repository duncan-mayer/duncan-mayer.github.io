### Biography 

I am social scientist with nearly a decade of research experience and expertise in several areas of applied statistics, particularly hierarchical models. Currently, I am Statistician with BeVera Solutions (Atlanta, GA) and a PhD candidate in social welfare at the Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH), working with the Center on Poverty and Community Development. 

My research has covered a range of topics in quantitative methods, program evaluation, public policy, and organizational studies. My dissertation research explores several critical questions in community-organizations dynamics and organizational demography; exploring the distribution of organizations and the benefits they bring to their regions.
