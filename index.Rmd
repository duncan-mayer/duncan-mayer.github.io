### Bio 

I am a social worker and currently a PhD candidate in social welfare at the Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. 

My research is in nonprofit studies, ranging from understanding how organizations use data to financial management. My current research is focused on community-organizations dynamics: the distribution of organizations and the benefits they bring to their regions. I also maintain an interest in program evaluation and applied statistics.
