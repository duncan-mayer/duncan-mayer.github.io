### Bio 

I am a social worker and currently a PhD candidate in social welfare at the Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. 

My research involves community organization dynamics (particularly nonprofits)- this includes the distribution of organizations and the benefits they bring to their regions. I also maintain an interest in applied statistics.
