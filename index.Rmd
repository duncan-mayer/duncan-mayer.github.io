**This website is deprecated**, see my [new website](https://duncanjmayer.netlify.app/), for updates. Eventually I'll transfer the domain.

I'm Duncan J. Mayer. I am a quantitative social scientist (data scientist) with nearly a decade of experience with research and data analysis. I maintain good coding practices and am comfortable building, evaluating, and interpreting everything from well known algorithms to bespoke models. I bring domain expertise in organizational theory and the use of data in organizations.

I'm a statistician at BeVera Solutions and a PhD candidate with the Center on Poverty and Community Development in the Jack Joesph, and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University
